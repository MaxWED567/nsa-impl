# Efficient Implementation of Native Sparse Attention Kernel

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-Release%20v1.0.0-blue)

Welcome to the **nsa-impl** repository! This project offers an efficient implementation of the Native Sparse Attention (NSA) kernel. The NSA kernel is designed to optimize attention mechanisms in deep learning models, making them faster and more memory-efficient. This README provides all the necessary information to get started with the project, including installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.

## Features

- **Efficiency**: The NSA kernel significantly reduces the computational load, allowing for faster processing.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale to larger datasets and models without a loss in performance.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple API for easy integration into existing projects.

## Installation

To install the NSA implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaxWED567/nsa-impl.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nsa-impl
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` for this:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MaxWED567/nsa-impl/releases). Execute the downloaded file to complete the installation.

## Usage

To use the NSA kernel in your project, follow these simple steps:

1. Import the module:

   ```python
   from nsa_impl import NativeSparseAttention
   ```

2. Initialize the kernel with your parameters:

   ```python
   nsa = NativeSparseAttention(dim=128, heads=8)
   ```

3. Call the forward method with your input data:

   ```python
   output = nsa(input_data)
   ```

Refer to the [Releases section](https://github.com/MaxWED567/nsa-impl/releases) for detailed examples and documentation.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the NSA kernel effectively:

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
import torch
from nsa_impl import NativeSparseAttention

# Sample input
input_data = torch.rand(10, 32, 128)  # (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)

# Initialize the NSA kernel
nsa = NativeSparseAttention(dim=128, heads=8)

# Forward pass
output = nsa(input_data)
print(output.shape)  # Expected output shape
```

### Example 2: Advanced Configuration

```python
import torch
from nsa_impl import NativeSparseAttention

# Sample input
input_data = torch.rand(10, 32, 128)

# Initialize with custom parameters
nsa = NativeSparseAttention(dim=128, heads=8, dropout=0.1)

# Forward pass
output = nsa(input_data)
print(output.shape)
```
